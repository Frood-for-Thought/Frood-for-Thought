# üëã Hi, I‚Äôm Michael Frood (@Frood-for-Thought)
Thanks for viewing my GitHub profile. 
I enjoy studying programming and learning what others have to teach me so I can help others with what I have learned.  
I‚Äôve studied biophysics whereby I programmed Monte Carlo simulations to describe bacterial evolution to antibiotics.  
As I study programming, I enjoy learning all the overlapping science and mathematics between physics and data science and analytics.

## üå± I‚Äôm Currently Learning 
- Currently I‚Äôm learning data analytics and data science, as well as creating projects in data analytics, data science, and physics.
- I'm always looking to improve my programming skills.
- Studying the mathematical parallels between physics and machine learning.

## üî≠ My Projects
### Here are some of the projects I've been working on:
**LHL-Statistical-Modelling-with-Python-Project:** 
Connect to CityBike, Yelp, and Foursquare APIs using Python in order to extract data from multiple locations,
and then demonstrate a relationship between the POIs of that location through a multivariate OLS regression model.
Data is stored in an SQL database. The function takes on a Poisson general linearized model.  
A logit classification model is constructed using the variables as well.

**Fitting-Most-Optimal-Constants-for-Bacterial-Chemotaxis-Equation:**
The directed migration of bacteria along a food gradient is called chemotaxis and the speed bacteria travel directed up the gradient 
is called the drift velocity.  The slope of a food gradient and a drift velocity per position is known.  
The goal of the project is to use data analysis with Python to filter out a list of potential constants per position for use in a 
stochastic bacterial movement algorithm constructed in MATLAB. The constants control the probability moving up and down the gradient. 
By fitting the right constants, the random run-and-tumble algorithm velocity will resemble the known theoretical drift velocity.
Some of the results are visualized in Tableau.

**Ising_MCMC_Bacterial_Evolution_to_Antibiotics:**
A Markov Chain Monte Carlo Ising Model for Bacterial Evolution constructed in Python. 
Using the mathematical model in ferromagnetism in statistical mechanics called the Ising Model as a basis in order to create a new program 
to simulate how an antibiotic gradient affects the rate of mutation of a bacterial population. A new Hamiltonian equation is constructed 
to govern the probability of acceptance, (the weights between nodes), for a Metropolis‚ÄìHastings algorithm.

## üíûÔ∏è I‚Äôm Looking to Collaborate
  I'm always happy to collaborate, learn, and improve.  I would like to work more on data analytics and data science projects.
